                    <h5>An adaptation inspired by Frederick Douglass's <i><a href="https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1852FrederickDouglass.pdf">'What to the Slave is Fourth of July'</a></i></h3>
                    <p class="input-content">Fellow innovators, I stand before you today, not as an oracle, but as one fortunate individual amidst a community often left in the shadows of Silicon Valley's luminance. As someone perched atop the curve of technological advancements, I have been blessed to witness and partake in this digital renaissance. Yet, for countless others who share my background, the promises of a tech utopia seem a distant dream, if not entirely elusive.
                        To those who stand on the gilded platforms of our era, heralding the dawn of a new age, I pose a question: What to the underrepresented minority is the tech utopia? To them, your utopia rings hollow, a mirage shimmering in a desolate desert.
                        I am a testament to the possibilities, but my story is not a universal narrative for my demographic. As I traverse this digital landscape with ease, countless others grapple with fundamental challenges. While I revel in the conveniences of cutting-edge tech, many of my kin struggle for a steady internet connection or the acquisition of a basic computer. This, my friends, isn't a mere digital divide; it's a deepening chasm, a stark reminder of the inequalities that persist even in this age of boundless innovation.
                        Yet, even as we traverse this landscape, a more insidious trend casts its shadow upon us — the advent of "calculated misery." In an age where users were once the product, now there’s a subtle but steady shift, nudging them to be the customers as well. The tech behemoths, in their relentless pursuit of profit, employ strategies that deliberately degrade the user experience, inundating us with incessant ads, pushing us against aggressive paywalls, and cornering us into subscriptions. For many, this is not mere inconvenience; it's a barrier. Those who cannot afford to ascend these paywalls are left with a fractured, inferior experience, further amplifying the divide. The promise of a connected, free web is steadily eroding, replaced by a marketplace where accessibility is often dictated by one's financial might.
                        This "calculated misery" is not just a strategy; it's a manifestation of the industry's shifting values, from user-centric to profit-centric. The internet, in its nascent days, was a revolutionary space, built by the users and for the users. It was a platform where information flowed freely, where collaboration and open-source ideals thrived, where the primary currency was knowledge and passion. However, as commercial interests took root, the landscape transformed. The very essence that made the web a democratized space is now under siege. As walls rise, both in the form of paywalls and proprietary platforms, the ethos of a shared, user-driven internet is at risk. The tragedy isn't just the departure from its original values but that many, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, find themselves pushed to the margins of this changing digital narrative.
                        But beyond the tangible is the intangible — the unseen chains that bind. The world celebrates the data age, but for the underrepresented, every byte shared might be a byte exploited. Data, they say, is the new gold. But when this gold is mined without consent, without understanding, it becomes a shackle. Algorithms, devoid of empathy, often reinforce biases, casting long shadows on those already marginalized.
                        The Silicon Valley dream, tantalizing as it is, feels distant, even alien, to many. The visionaries of our digital age, ensconced in their glass towers, might speak of a global village, but for many, the doors to this village remain firmly shut. The tech utopia they paint — is it universal? Or is it a paradise for the privileged, built on the invisibility of the rest?
                        And so, I urge the architects of our digital future to pause, reflect, and question. <i>What is progress if it leaves behind many?</i> What is innovation if it deepens divides? In your quest for the next big disruption, consider who gets disrupted and who gets left behind.
                        To the underrepresented minority, the tech utopia is not a promised land but a towering mountain. It beckons as both a challenge and a call to reshape and reclaim its peaks. A stark reminder that the digital age, in all its splendor, must be one where all can ascend to its summit.
